# EmployeeTracker
Our assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
## About
The purpose of this challenge was to create an employee tracker while using Node.js, Inquierer, and MySQL to develope the back end of the application. It'll allow the user to view, add, and update employee information, including their roles and departments. The application uses MySQL to store and manage data and Inquirer.js to prompt the user for input.
### Installations 
Download node.js, inquirer, and Mysql

Clone the repository.
#### Usage
Initialize VS code 

Open the terminal and ensure you are in the right file path.

Run the command npm install to download the packages.

Then run the command node index.js to run the software.

The command prompt will begin on your terminal
